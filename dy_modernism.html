<h1>Interactions are Place Specific</h1>
<p>Characters do not merely interact, they do so in particular contexts.</p>
<p>There are <strong>31</strong> character types that combine in <strong>528</strong> different ways across <strong>14</strong> different types of locations. Figuring out these relationships becomes very complicated.</p>

<h1>Principal Component Analysis</h1>
<p>Principal Component Analysis is a useful technique to reduce the number of dimensions in a data set.</p>
<p>It calculates which components account for the most variance in the data.</p>
<p>One common application is in genetics research, where cancer cells might have thirty different properties. No one individual property makes it malignant, but some combinations are worse than others.</p>
